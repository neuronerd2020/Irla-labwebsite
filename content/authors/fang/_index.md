Fang received his doctorate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He was then trained at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, as a postdoctoral fellow. In November 2021, he joined Professor Waites’s Laboratory. Scientifically, he is interested in understanding pathogenesis and exploring new therapeutic strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Fang loves cooking, hiking and traveling with his baby.
