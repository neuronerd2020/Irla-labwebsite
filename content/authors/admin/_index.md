Clarissa is the Waites lab cheerleader, fundraiser, copy editor, and primary ‘Dad joke’ generator. Prior to venturing east to start her lab at Columbia, Clarissa spent many years on the West Coast as an undergraduate at Stanford University, a graduate student in Robert Edwards’ lab at UCSF, and a postdoctoral fellow in Craig Garner’s lab at Stanford. She has had a long-standing interest in the mechanisms of neuronal communication and protein homeostasis, including synapse formation, synaptic transmission and plasticity, and synaptic protein turnover. When she’s not at the lab, Clarissa can be found biking, hiking, or climbing in upstate New York, or enjoying the cultural and culinary wonders of NYC.
