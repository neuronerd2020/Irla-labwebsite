In the Waites lab, Veronica studied the trafficking patterns of the ESCRT pathway in axons and defended her thesis over Zoom in May 2020. Prior to graduate school Veronica studied neuroscience and molecular biology at Wesleyan University in CT, where her undergraduate thesis on the biophysical properties of DNA four-way junctions was awarded high honors. Veronica enjoys hiking, science fiction, and spending time with her dog Herb. She currently works as a life sciences consultant at Trinity Life Sciences in NYC.
