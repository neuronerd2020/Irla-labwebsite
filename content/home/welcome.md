<font size="-1"> <p style="color:turquoise"> A major goal of our research is to elucidate mechanisms of protein turnover and degradation in the brain. Degradative pathways (e.g. endolysosomal, autophagy, ubiquitin proteasome system) are an important component of the proteostasis machinery in all cells, supporting nervous system health by preventing toxic protein accumulation and aggregation. Neurons in particular are dependent on these pathways to eliminate damaged/misfolded proteins that can precipitate synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While the importance of protein degradation for neuronal health is widely recognized, the basic mechanisms that mediate this process remain poorly understood, particularly at synapses. Members of the Waites lab are studying molecular and cellular mechanisms of degradative protein sorting, with a focus on glutamatergic synapses. We are also investigating how dysfunction of these mechanisms contributes to pathological conditions including neurodegeneration.</font> </p>
